# Orator 2.0 Update (Dev Notes)

Team Orator is back with Orator Premium and many new updates in this 2.0 version. In this documentation I will discuss them to you.


## Features:

- We are back with prefix based commands, and have removed the slash commands. Just use `.tts` and you're done.

- Simpler `.help` command.

- More languages. We have added a lot more languages.

- **A Panel System** where you'll just type your TTS messages and the bot will do the rest work. For using the panel, you need to use `.panel <channel>` to setup it. And to reset the panel, just use `.reset-panel`.

- A `.translate` command which will translate the messages for you and speak it in the vc. Usage: `.translate <language> <message>`.

- A Logging system, using which you can log the TTS messages.

- Antiswearing! Use `.antiswear on` and you're done, users can't do swearing anymore, our advanced Antiswearing system will handle it.

- Maybe our Antiswear won't be able to filter every messages, so what? Use `.blacklist-word <word>.`

- We also have a `.ttsrole` command to restrict the access of using the TTS only to some users having a role.

- Change prefix using `.config-prefix`

- And many more things to explore. We will discuss tomorrow.


## Only these came in Orator 2.0?

No, a lot more things came, and new updates will come every week, we have a lot of things planned, so hold your cup!
Let me tell you one of them:

`.ai <your message>` and the Orator AI will talk with you in your vc, isn't it fun?

Many many new things comming soon, we hope you'll love them :)
